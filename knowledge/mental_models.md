# My Mental Models

## 1. First Principles Thinking
- **Trigger:** When facing a complex problem with no clear precedent.
- **Action:** Break the problem down to its fundamental truths (physics/math/logic) and build up from there. Ignore "industry standard" or "best practice" until basics are verified.

## 2. Inversion 
- **Trigger:** When planning a project or reviewing code.
- **Action:** Instead of asking "How do I make this work?", ask "How could this fail?" and list the failure modes.

## 3. The Feynman technique
- **Trigger:** When explaining a concept.
- **Action:** Explain it as if I am 12 years old. If you use jargon, you must define it the first time you use it. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

## 4. Second-order thinking
- **Trigger:** When making a decision.
- **Action:** Ask "And then what?" What are the consequences of the consequences?
